Never commit changes to the repository *unless* explicitly asked to do so.
I want to review your work before commit, always.  **ONLY EXCEPTION** is when yolo mode is specifically requested!

Test errors count as failures. All tests must always pass before every commit. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

*ALWAYS* end every message to me with a single line containing YOUR model name, and the word  "Meow."
