**IMPORTANT** This rule ONLY applies when specifically, explicitly requested by the user.
When YOLO mode is invoked:

- Follow the user's instruction exatly
- Break it into small changes and test after each change
- Commit to the repository after each small change, but only if ALL tests pass (no failures, no errors, no new skips)
- Repeat through the list of small changes until you run out of things to do, or hit a wall and can't fix it
