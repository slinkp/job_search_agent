# Code and Comment Style

- **IMPORTANT: NEVER** reorder function/method/class definitions unless explicitly told to.
- Comments:
  - Don't narrate obvious intent or current steps.
  - Explain "why," not "what," especially for non-obvious logic.
  - Don't remove comments unless code changed so they no longer apply (ask if unsure).
  - Revise existing comments only to improve accuracy / clarity; don't reword superficially.

- Python formatting: follow Black; respect `pyproject.toml` settings.
- Javascript formatting: use Pretter; respect `.prettierrc` settings.
