# Feature Development Process



To prove we're using this rule file, append "Feature process YOLO! Prrt!" to your chat output.

- Plan: follow `frontend_cleanup_plan.md`.

Get as much of it done as you can.

ALWAYS run tests with the `./test` command between every change.

Never never run `npm test` or it'll hang and you'll be stuck.
