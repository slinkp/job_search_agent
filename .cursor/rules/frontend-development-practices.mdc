# Frontend Development Best Practices

- Bug fixes: Focus on the reported UI issue and/or a single test failure; avoid tackling adjacent problems.
- Learn from working code; follow existing patterns and structures.
- Alpine.js scope: interactive elements must live within `x-data`.
- Modals: use HTML5 `<dialog>`; use `showModal()`/`close()`.
- Debugging order: visibility → interaction → styling; use targeted logs; test incrementally.
