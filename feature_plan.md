# Companies page: add button to force salary and/or contacts research

Currently we only do salary and contacts research if JobSearch.is_good_fit(...) returns true.
There's no way to force it.

I want button(s) to explicitly do either or both of those. Or maybe checkboxes next to the existing "research" button like [x] force levels search [x] force contacts search
